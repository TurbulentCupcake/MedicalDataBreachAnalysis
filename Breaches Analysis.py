# Q1. Which states are most affected by the medical breaches?
# We can infer from the data that the total number of occurances of a certain state under 
# the State column indicates the number of breaches that have occured in that particular
# state

g = sns.factorplot('State', data = breach_df, kind = 'count', palette = 'winter_d', aspect = 3)
g.fig.get_axes()[0].set_yscale('log')


# In[9]:

# As we can see, California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and New York
# take the top 5 positions for most occurances of medical breaches


# In[10]:

# Q2. How many individuals (by state) were affected by these breaches ?


# In[11]:

# Here we use the groupby function to group the dataframe in terms of state in order to get the 
# individuals affected for each state
affected = breach_df.groupby('State').sum()

# As we can see, Indiana seems to have an unreasonably high number of individuals affected due to 
# medical breaches. How does this relate to the number of breaches that occur in the state? 


# In[14]:

# Seemingly, although Indiana has the highest number of individuals affected, it ranks 7th in the 
# total number of breaches per state
breach_df['State'].value_counts().sort_values().tail(10)


# In[15]:

# Let us try to find a correlation here between the number of breaches in each state and the 
# individuals affected. After the above analysis, my intuition tells me that there is not much
# correlation between the total number of breaches for each state and the number of individuals
# affected. Lets test that out.


# In[16]:

#In order to do the above, we have to create a DataFrame that contains columns for the number of 
# individuals affected in each state and the number of breaches in each state.


# In[17]:

# Getting the number of breaches per state 
BreachByState = breach_df['State'].value_counts()

# In[22]:

# As we can see, the correlation between the two factors is 0.246021, since the
# value is close to 0, it indicates that the two factors are weakly correlated 
# (do not depend alot on each other). Hence our intuition is correct.  


# In[23]:

#We can map this correlation in a simple 2x2 matrix
sns.heatmap(breach_df2.corr())


# In[24]:

# Q3. What is the most common type of breaches? 


# In[25]:

#Lets get the values of every type of breach
BreachVals = DataFrame(breach_df['Type of Breach'].value_counts().rename('Breach Count'))


# In[26]:

BreachVals


# In[32]:

#Lets set a name to the types of breaches mentioned in the dataframe

# In[44]:

# As we can see, plain old theft seems to be the main cause of breaches of medical data


# In[45]:

# Q.4 How does the number of affected people change across the time period described by the 
# dataset?


# In[67]:

breach_df.head()


# In[71]:

# In essence, we would like a monthly timeline that displays the change in affected individuals
# across the range of years provided by the dataset. 


# In[72]:

#Let us design a function such that we get the data we need. 


# In[139]:

month = []
year = []
for date in breach_df['Breach Submission Date']:
    month.append(date[0:2])
    year.append(date[6:len(date)])


# In[142]:

breach_df['Month'] = month
breach_df['Year'] = year
breach_df = breach_df.drop('Timeline Position', axis = 1)


# In[143]:

breach_df.head()


# In[224]:

monthGroup = breach_df.groupby(['Year','Month'])


# In[236]:

monthlyAffected = monthGroup.sum()


# In[243]:

monthlyAffected.plot(kind = 'line', figsize = (14,6), logy = True,color = 'green')
#Add a trend line bruh wut u doin


# In[244]:

# as we can see, there is a noticiable inconsistency in the number of individuals who are being affected by medical data 
# breaches. Although, we can certainlly notice an increasing trend indicicating greater security measures must be taken
# in order to protect data


# In[245]:

# Q.5 Is there any correlation between the type of theft and number of people affected?


# In[246]:

AffectedBreachTypes = breach_df.groupby('Type of Breach')


# In[253]:

Total_Affected = AffectedBreachTypes.sum()


# In[262]:

Total_Affected.plot(kind = 'bar', rot = 90, logy = True, title = 'Total Affected vs Breach Type', color = 'teal', figsize = (13,4))


# In[263]:

# Another observation arises, we note from the above graph that most individuals are affected by Hacking/IT incidents, but 
# our earlier analysis showed that most of the data was lost (to a great degree) due to theft. This is not to say that 
# Theft plays a small role in affecting people. As we can see, Theft follows Hacking/IT as the second highest factor
# affecting people through breaches. 


# In[264]:

# For our last exercise, lets look for any correlation between the type of breach and the number of people affected by 
# these breaches. 
breach_df3 = pd.concat([Total_Affected,BreachVals], axis = 1)


# In[265]:

breach_df3.corr()


# In[266]:

# As we can see, there is only a very small correlation between the number of people affected and the type of breaches.
